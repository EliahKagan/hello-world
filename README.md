# hello-world - ~~tutorial repo~~ bot and CI testing

## 2023-09-25

Testing git-push-forward (from gitscripts repo): A, B

I'm converting this to a repo for bot and CI testing and making it public.

Original contents follow, for posterity, and for richer content for CI and bots
to scan/use, where applicable.

Although unusual for a readme, writing this in changelog style may be useful to
test bots/actions that automatically scan changelogs.

Strikethrough in a heading is sometimes undesirable, since some tools that
processing headings as text ignore formatting, including strikethrough,
resulting in the opposite of the intended message. But this may be useful to
test... you get the idea. <span title="Cat with Wry Smile">ðŸ˜¼</span>

I'm Eliah Kagan.

I've been using Git for a while, and I've even had a GitHub
account since 2012 or so. But I haven't been using GitHub for any of my own
repos... until today! <span title="Slightly Smiling Face">ðŸ™‚</span>
